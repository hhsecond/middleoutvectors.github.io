MiddleOut Vectors conceptualized eventually from different instances
- The involvement of human actions in the Word2Vec and GloVe algorithms. The 1 Hot encoding mechanism is not the simulation of human brain, it's just the work around we found to feed the input to the NN
- Human brain gets signals from images (through eyes) or sound/speech (through ears) even for natural languages. We see the texts or we hear it from people.
- With the existing implementations, if we want our robot to read a sign board or a text, we need an extra stage in the pipeline for converting the image to text which will be processed by NLP core. What if, an algorithm could convert the image directly to a meaning vector?!!
- MiddleOut ideology from Silicon Valley series ;)

We are trying to propose a system that could eliminate the drawbacks of existing SOTA meaning vector generators and generate the same efficiently and could be more meaningful.
