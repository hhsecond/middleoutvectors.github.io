MiddleOut Vectors conceptualized eventually from different instances
- The involvement of human intervention in the Word2Vec and GloVe algorithms. The 1 Hot encoding mechanism is not the simulation of human brain, it's just the work around we found to feed the input to the NN
- Human brain gets signals from images (through eyes) or sound/speech (through ears) even for natural languages. We see the texts or we hear it, we cannot feed it directly to the brain.
- With the existing implementations, if we want our robot to read a sign board or a text, we need an extra stage in the pipeline for converting the image to text which will be processed by NLP core. What if, an algorithm could convert the image directly to a **meaning vector**?!!
- With the existing implementations, if we want our robot to understand what we ask, we need an extra stage in the pipeline for converting the speech to text which will be processed by NLP core. What if, an algorithm could convert the speech directly to a **meaning vector**?!!
- MiddleOut ideology from Silicon Valley series ;)

We are trying to propose a system that could eliminate the drawbacks of existing SOTA __meaning vector__ generators and generate a more meaningful vector representation efficiently.
